Among the many technological innovations that contribute to the sustainable development goal dedicated to industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9), agent-based modeling and IoT-based crowdsourcing methods appear as promising approaches to, on the one hand, enable scientists and stakeholders to virtually explore the sustainability of different pathways in the management of complex socio-environmental systems and, on the other hand, empower stakeholders so that they themselves can monitor the progress of the chosen pathways. 
The objective of PREMISS is to demonstrate the extent to which a combination of these two technologies can effectively support transdisciplinary approaches, which are based on the integration of knowledge between disciplines and actors in society, which promote the creative and collaborative design of new problem-solving methods, and which are gradually becoming an essential part of the sustainability science paradigm to address complex socio-environmental problems.
PREMISS, handled by an international consortium gathering South-African, French, Turkish, Vietnamese and Taiwanese academic and non-academic partners, will (1) deliver a systematic review of the literature that addresses these subjects, with the goal of producing operational and policy conclusions alongside at least two scientific review papers; (2) implement and manage three case studies that represent the three nexuses formed by SDG 9 and, respectively, SDG 6 (about the sustainable management of irrigation systems, through participatory modeling, in Vietnam), SDG 13 (about citizen science and participatory environmental mapping in Taiwan) and SDG 15 (about the adoption and impact of sensor networks on precision agriculture in Turkey); (3) deliver a scholarly book and a methodological guide providing new perspectives and sets of recommendations to support transdisciplinary approaches in sustainability science projects.
