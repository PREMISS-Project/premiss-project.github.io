Here is some update from the Taiwanese part of the PREMISS project. 
They demonstrated the importance of interdisciplinarity within their case study, by reaching out to the Department of Mechanical Engineering of National Taiwan University.
The work of the Department of Mechanical Engineering is primarily directed toward the design and improvement of mechanical structures.
The current frame used to affix the NTU4AQ (the main sensor developped by the SC+NTU team) suffers from numerous problems in disassembly and assembly. 
It is very unergonomic and is not sufficiently stable.
Hence why the team sought help from the Mechanical Engineering Department to redesign it.
It is now easy to install and disassemble, and when necessary, staff can slowly pull it down without using a wrench.
This is a great example of the necessity to cooperate beyond disciplines and to not hesitate to ask for help when a different expertise is needed. 
It also shows that any team working on sustainability issues will probably need to gather a large range of expertise to be able to fully address wicked problems of our time.
