Last week, within the ACROSS laboratory in Vietnam, a training to modeling and simulation took place. 
More specifically, participants could familiarise themselves with the GAMA platform, built by the French-Vietnamese team of which some of its members work within ACROSS.
The training was facilitated by Patrick Taillandier, a researcher from INRAE seconded in ACROSS for four years. 
Administrative and managing staff, as well as researchers with a different background than computer science, were especially targeted by the training. 
The goal was for them to learn about the basic features of the GAMA platform and to get a hands-on perspective of their colleagues' work.

They each modeled a city facing a pandemic, representing infected inhabitants, immune and healed ones. 
Throughout the training, the complexity of the coding part increased, though the facilitator was there to help correcting mistakes and answering questions.

Overall, this training invited interested staff to broaden their knowledge of the topic and to continue working on their model. 
In an interdisciplinary laboratory, it is also important for the different members to have an understanding of what each and everyone works on and of the tools used. 
This participates to an improved cooperation between colleagues, as well as a more informed promotion of the team's activities.
