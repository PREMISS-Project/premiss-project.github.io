Finally, we would like to recommend the reading of the [following article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1476945X18301399?via%3Dihub) that brings a different perspective on agent-based participatory experiments with FarmAgriPoliS.
This paper aims to examine the extent to which human participants show higher resilience compared to computer agents in agent-based participatory experiments.
It motivates and examines three types of resilient behaviour of farmers during a crisis or as response to competitive pressure: successful survival, loss-minimising farm exits, and path breaking respectively path creating growth strategies.
