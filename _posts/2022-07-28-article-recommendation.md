Through the scanning process of the systematic and scoping review of the literature, we run into very interesting articles. 
And we want to share some with you. 
This week, we want to share the "Mitigating risks of perishable products in the cyber-physical systems based on the extended MRP model" article, by Bogataj and al. (2017)
You can find it with the following [link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2017.06.028). 

This paper focuses on a novel concept of moving activity cells which represent the moving cargo between the fixed activity cells in the extended material requirements planning (EMRP) model. 
The changes in NPV are calculated dynamically from the expected shelf life changes. Such real-time calculations and early reports are enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, where there is a smart device that tracks ambient conditions like temperature, humidity, and gas concentrations.
These early estimations allow a better decision making based on first-expired-first-out (FEFO) cold chain management strategies for perishable products.
Therefore, the model includes the possibility to deliver the items to the local market if the expected contractually stipulated shelf-life losses become too high.
