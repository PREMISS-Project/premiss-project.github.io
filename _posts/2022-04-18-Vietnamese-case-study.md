The Vietnamese case study focuses on the Bac Hung Hai irrigation system, in the center of the Red River Delta.

Its main goal is **the building of an integrated and hybrid framework consisting of innovative participative and transdisciplinary approaches in order to address threats to the system**, mainly upstream water depletion, pollutions and an increase in demand from several sources.

Mid-January 2022, a team made of ACROSS members (international laboratory hosting the PREMISS project) met with the main interlocutor of the case study, *the Bac Hung Hai water management company*, to understand the issues faced by the system and what its needs are.

Following this, a mapping of the main actors of the system has been initiated within ACROSS. 

Interviews have been conducted with different types of actors to understand their role in the water quality and quantity management, as well as how they are incorporated in the systemâ€™s network.

This information will be used to build the model supporting participatory simulations for the identification of sustainable solutions to the management of the irrigation system.

This constitutes the next key step for the case study.
