On November 22, at 1pm South African time (6pm in Vietnam), Dr. Louisa Prause, from the University of Western Cape, will bring together the food regime approach and critical technology studies to argue that rather than a revolution in agriculture, digitalisation deepens certain features of the existing food regime such as the retail sector's control over the global commodity chains, a high degree of oligopolistic corporate power and labour displacement. 
Using her fieldwork in Germany and South Africa, she will offer thoughts on how digital tools might be designed and used differently in order to foster a socio-ecological transformation of the corporate food regime. 
It will surely be a captivating presentation. You can register [here](https://uwc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_6R9u_9YDSOaGnjuRYa4rCw)!
