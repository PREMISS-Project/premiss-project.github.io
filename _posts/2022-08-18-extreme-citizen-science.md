At the heart of the summer, we would like to recommend the reading of a very enriching book about citizen science, more specifically extreme citizen science. 
The book focuses especially on the challenges of literacy in general and scientific literacy in particular (especially access to technology), as well as supporting citizens to find the time to engage with scientific activities and effectively interact with the digital technologies which enable them.
It is the concept of geographic citizen science. 
This study is based on 12 case studies from all over the world - the Global North, as well as indigenous communities in non-urban areas, which make it particularly concrete and understandable.
