Thanks to Dr. du Plessis’s abstract selection, the PREMISS team will submit an article in September 2022 for its publication in the journal *Citizen Science and Theory*’s Special Collection.
Dr. du Plessis will be the main author and coordinate our team for the common writing of the article.
This Special Collection focuses on contributions of citizen science to the SDGs and international development frameworks.
The paper entitled “Making citizen science socio-politically relevant through a transdisciplinary approach to ecological complex challenges” focuses on South African citizen scientists, their impacts and contributions to the development of global ecological knowledge.
The protection of the environment is a growing political contention point between citizens and the government in the South African context and transdisciplinary approaches are a possible solution to provide the necessary socio-political support to international environmental agreements and frameworks.
