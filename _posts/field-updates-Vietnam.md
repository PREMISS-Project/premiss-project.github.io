An initial series of participatory workshops with farmers and village leaders was held in Phạm Trấn on 28th June ([article about the first session](https://premiss-project.github.io/2022-06-27-EcoGame/)) enabling a first set of tests of the rác serious game. It is used as a discussion and mediation tool.
This week, a second series was organized in the same commune with new players, on 20th July. 
The objective this time was to test the first hypotheses which emerged from the initial workshop.
Two games were played with 24 farmers and 1 village leader.
Results have shown that players consider the objectives of the game reached, e.g. raising public’s awareness and teaching the functioning of complex systems. 
Moreover, the message of the game on the importance of collaboration when dealing with environmental issues was well understood.

NB: The serious game has been renamed from EcoGame to rác which means waste in Vietnamese.
