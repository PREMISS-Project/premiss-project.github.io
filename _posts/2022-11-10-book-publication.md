This week, the whole PREMISS team gathered in a meeting to discuss our academic book publication and methodological guide. 
Those are the whole purpose and main deliverables of the project's 3rd Workpackage, led by the South African team. 
we discussed the objectives of those two different publications, the framework we want to give them, the work distribution and timeframe.  
Publishing such work is a strenuous process that requires anticipation as we need to coordinate with the publication house that will embark on this adventure with us. 
This is nonetheless an exciting experience and we are ready to take on the task. 
The meeting was also the opportunity to review the state of each and everyone's job within PREMISS and to get some updates on how everyone is doing! 
We are always happy to get to see each other online as we work on three different continents.
