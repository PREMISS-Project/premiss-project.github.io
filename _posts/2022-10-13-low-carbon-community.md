In August, our friends in Taiwan worked hard for the community, more specifically for the people of Daxue Village. 
Exchanges took place with the mayor of the village, as well as members of the community. 
The mayor gave a briefing on the carbon reduction measures in the village to the 70 residents who attended the meeting.

A member of the NTU team also introduced the NTU4AQ upgraded sensors to the participants and explained how the installation of sensors can help the community to conduct climate action. 
The whole group then went on a walk in the village to witness the actions set up by the residents to lessen the effects of the heat island. 

The NTU4AQ sensors developed by the project team are an application of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. 
By transmitting data through the network, the observed data can be automatically sent back to the database to digitize the real world. 
The sensors used have the advantage to connect a large number of IoT devices, to have wide coverage, low power consumption, long battery life, and are produced at a low cost compared to other devices.
