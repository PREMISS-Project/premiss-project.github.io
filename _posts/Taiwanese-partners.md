National Taiwan University has set up a monthly Newsletter to share and promote their sustainable action plans in Southern Taipei City towards a larger audience. It is produced in both Chinese and English. The newsletter goes over the summary of the monthly activities and a little bit more in depth about a specific point (achievements and announcements), as well as giving a science tip for the interested audience. Finally, there is always a presentation of the team. 
The Chinese version is available [here](http://www.ipcs.ntu.edu.tw/page/about/index.aspx?kind=2169) and the English one under [this link](http://www.ipcs.ntu.edu.tw/page/about/index.aspx?kind=2170).
