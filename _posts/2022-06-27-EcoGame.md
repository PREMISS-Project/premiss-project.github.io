After a few months of work to identify the most relevant sustainability issues threatening the Bac Hung Hai irrigation system in Northern Vietnam, through a series of field visits, meetings and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, the ACROSS                                                                                                                                                                                (Advanced Computational Research for Sustainability Science, Thuyloi University - IRD) team has been able to build a model and design a serious game questioning to which extent does the reduction of pollution enhance agricultural productivity.
Several versions of EcoGame already exist as several tests have already been conducted, especially with the participation of the youth: students from the Hanoi University of Science and Technology, from the French International School ranging from middle to high school.
At this stage and based on the evaluation survey filled by students, even though the serious game still leaves room for improvement, the vast majority of participants have apprehended complexity of responding to socio-environmental issues when these are tangled with contradictory demands from different stakeholders, impeding the design of management strategies that can be sustainable. 
In the long run, training and workshops are envisioned to support interactions between researchers, policy-makers, and other stakeholders to explore and compare the impact of various plans, in different scenarios, before implementation.
