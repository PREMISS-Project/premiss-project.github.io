In the framework of the PREMISS Belmont-Forum project, a multidisciplinary team from the ACROSS international joint laboratory (Thuyloi University/IRD) developed a serious game, called EcoGame, for the exploration of sustainable solutions to irrigation system management in Vietnam.
After a few months of work to identify the most pressing issues threatening the Bac Hung Hai irrigation system in northern Vietnam, through a series of field visits, meetings and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders, the team was able to build a model and design a serious game, asking to what extent pollution reduction can improve agricultural productivity.

In June 2022, a first series of participatory workshops with farmers and village leaders marked an important step in the research, allowing to verify its contribution in terms of a discussion and mediation tool. In the long term, training and workshops are envisaged to support interactions between researchers, policy makers and other stakeholders to explore and compare the impact of different plans, in different scenarios, before they are implemented.
