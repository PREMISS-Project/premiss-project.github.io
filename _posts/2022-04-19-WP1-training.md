The WP1 of the PREMISS project is responsible for the production of systematic reviews on the extent to which ABM and IoT solutions support the successful implementation of transdisciplinary approaches.

To make sure all the partners are on the same page in terms of methodology and with the ambition of building capacities of young researchers and students of the different teams, IRD Vietnam organises two training sessions to the production of such reviews.

An expert from France, LÃ©a Lugassy, will introduce the specific methodology and will then oversee the discussions on the very own research protocol of the project in the second session.

By the end of the training, the consortium should have agreed on the processes to conduct WP1, so as to move to the next step of the task.

It is a key opportunity in terms of capacity building for team members not familiar with the specific features of scoping and systematic reviews, as well as collecting a diversity of perspectives on the research protocol.
