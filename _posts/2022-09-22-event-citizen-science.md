The European Citizen Science Association's vision is that all citizens in Europe are valued and empowered as actors in advancing knowledge and innovation, and thus supporting sustainable development. 
The association's members want to establish citizen science as a recognized, promoted and funded approach, one that fosters scientific literacy and the democratization of science.
Through this, they want to see an increase in the social relevance and sustainable impact of research, and a stronger evidence base for policy processes, in Europe and globally.

On November 16th, they organize the following event at 4pm Brussels time: "Learning from mistakes: failures in citizen science".
This seems of particular interest for the PREMISS project and its community.
