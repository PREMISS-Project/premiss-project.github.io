Besides its successful summer internship program, its mobile monitoring projects, the Taiwanese team took part in key meetings this summer, starting with the Ministry of Education's "University Social Responsibility" activities. 
This event aims to share experiences and training universities set up towards social responsibility. 
The NTU SC+ team shared its deep engagement in the use of technology to sense environmental values, observe local data, and promote community environmental awareness and climate action.

The International Degree Program in Climate Change and Sustainable Development (IPCS) also partnered with the Central Weather Bureau to jointly organized a workshop on climate services. 
Representatives from NTUâ€™s departments of Atmospheric Sciences, Geography, Biomechatronics Engineering, the Yunlin Branch of NTU Hospital were all invited, as well as representatives from the Bureau of Meteorology, Youth Climate Alliance (TWYCC), NTU Sustainability Department, and the SC+ team. 
The discussions covered a variety of topics, including the possibility of various issues in climate services, dealing with questions of spatio-temporal scale, gaining a deeper understanding of current technologies and shortages, and hoping to add vitality to efforts promoting the climate service industry.
