The [2022 Sustainability Research and Innovation Congress](https://sri2022.org/) will take place from 20th to 24th June in Pretoria, South Africa, both online and offline.

The Sustainability Research & Innovation Congress is a series of gatherings that unite global research leaders, experts, industries and innovators to inspire action and promote a sustainability transformation.

A joint initiative of [Future Earth](https://futureearth.org/) and the [Belmont Forum](https://www.belmontforum.org/), the SRI Congress is a space of dedicated advocacy for sustainability scholarship and innovation, transdisciplinary and cross-sectoral collaboration and action.

This edition is hosted by Future Africa Institute at the University of Pretoria, with the goal of amplifying the voice of sustainability science and innovation in the Global South, specifically for the African continent, through raising awareness and propelling discussions about sustainable priorities for Africa.

[IRD](https://www.ird.fr/), in cooperation with Nelson Mandela University, CNRS and Future Earth, aims to organise a side-event to discuss concepts and opportunities for the sustainability science field in terms of funding sources and tools.

Alexis Drogoul, principal investigator of the PREMISS project, is already involved in the preparation of the event.

Hester du Plessis, the South African partner of PREMISS, will also represent the team in a panel organised by the Africa Futures Institutes on “Dialoguing and/or deliberating, and “doing” change - Where to for transdisciplinary research in Africa?”.
