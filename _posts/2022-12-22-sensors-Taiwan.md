The SC+ team in Taipei, Taiwan, has developed a tool of great importance for them: the MAPS6 miniature sensor. 
It is lightweight and mobile, can inform a variety of perspectives that drive citizen participation, as well as obtaining higher spatial and temporal resolution to facilitate analysis at different scales.
Thanks to it, the Taiwanese team has been able to conduct a variety of research projects, including two that were the focus of the summer internships:
- Mobile monitoring of air quality in Xinyi District,
- Spatial representation of micro-sensors in complex environments.

The study explores the concentration distribution of PM2.5 in the main road sections of Xinyi commercial district from the perspective of tourists and consumers.
More specifically, the sensors aim at analysing the degree of comfort for tourists in Xinyi District, taking into account the air quality and the temperature among other parameters.
They compare the differences between MAPS6 and reference stations under different environments through experimentation.
Using the MAPS6 device fixed around a personâ€™s waist, the time resolution is 1 record per minute. Strava is used to record the movement path, and by means of mobile monitoring, measurments are taken during the peak time of crowds around 4:00 pm to the end of the peak dinner time at 7:00 pm.
Based on the measurements and analyses, the team is able to produce recommendations to improve citizens' comfort.  
Here is a picture of the sensors:
