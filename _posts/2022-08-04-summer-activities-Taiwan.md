The Taiwanese team at National Taiwan University (NTU) is having a busy summer. 
A whole new group of interns joined the summer program, all interested in climate change and sustainability. 
Four of them have research topics particularly close to the focus of the International Degree Program in Climate Change and Sustainable Development (IPCS). 
On top of that, the team has been working on updating the mobile version of the NTU on-campus life dashboard, to simplify its use and make it clearer. 
The dashboard is a tool for climate education and understanding how the climate can impact health and life of campus' users. 
Finally, the Taiwanese team has started to conduct a preliminary study on indoor comfort in the campus' classrooms, based on a literature review and a survey sent to students. 
Told you they never stop!
