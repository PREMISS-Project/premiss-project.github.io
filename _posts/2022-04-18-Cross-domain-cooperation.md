The Taiwanese case study focuses on the creation of a metropolitan Taipei climate map that can support local action plans, using the data obtained by the sensors and local knowledge, in a participatory sensing and citizen science approach.

In February, along with a scale and scope expansion of its project, the Taiwanese team acknowledged its need for support from other research fields. 

Cross-domain cooperation has been the focus of the month, promoting the exchange of diverse ideas, generating sparks of knowledge, and increasing overall progress towards project completion.

This was especially applied to data analysis. 

One of the sub initiatives - the Smart Street Lightning Project - has been debriefed to identify the most suitable illuminance standards for switch lights within the NTU campus, in order to save energy each day. 

Li&Der instruments, a key partner providing some of the instruments of the project, visited the campus to discuss the cooperation at stake, including follow-up course lectures, station installations and micro-sensor development cooperation between the two parties.

In order to stimulate and enhance community residentsâ€™ awareness of climate change and the environment, the team introduced IoT technologies, used micro-sensors to monitor the pedestrian-scale microclimate in the community, and released their scientific research results to community residents.

These efforts inspired citizens to participate in living environment improvement planning, climate change, etc., and even lead to behavioral changes.
